# **Unity Environment for Reinforcement Learning**

This project serves as a **simulation/environment** for a reinforcement learning project that utilizes **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**. The environment is designed to train and evaluate agents in a 3D platform setting.

For more information and context, please refer to the main repository:
